pyeq3: an equation, curve and surface fitting library
=====================================================

pyeq3 is a large collection of python3 equations that perform curve fitting on 2D and 3D data,
output source code in several computing languages, and run a genetic algorithm for initial parameter estimation.
The module comes with cluster, parallel, IPython, GUI, NodeJS, and web-based graphical examples.
It includes orthogonal distance and relative error regressions.

pyeq3 is released under a permissive license. It relies on numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
